\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives}

Taking motivation from the information presented in the previous sections, this work has been elaborated with the objective of creating a PCG system to design cave-like dungeon maps for 2D top-down games.

More specifically, we will:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{} Generate varied and cave-like dungeon maps from the combination of different algorithms.

\item \textbf{} Contribute to the PCG category of 'design of level content' by generating levels that can serve as a blueprint for game designers to build upon on the future.

\item \textbf{} Provide maps based on a set of criteria found in bibliography for what is considered a good dungeon map.

\item \textbf{} Evaluate if the generated maps match the criteria through a survey applied to video-game players.

\end{itemize}

\section{Organization of this work}

Next, on Chapter \ref{chapter:related}, we will cover works that are related to this one. After that, on Chapter \ref{chapter:proposal} our proposal will be expanded on and some background information will be provided in order to fully understand it. Following that, on chapter \ref{chapter:dev} we will provide details on our development and implementation. Chapter \ref{chapter:survey} will cover the creation of the survey and its results. Lastly on Chapter \ref{chapter:conclusion} we will discuss the conclusions of our work.
