\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives}

Taking motivation from the information presented in the previous sections, this work has been elaborated with the objective of creating a PCG system to design cave-like dungeon maps for 2D top-down games.

More specifically, we will:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{} Utilize a number of algorithms that, combined with user inputs, can generate varied and cave-like dungeon maps.

\item \textbf{} Focus on the PCG category of 'design of level content'. The generated levels can serve as a blueprint for game designers to build upon on the future.

\item \textbf{} Create the maps based on a set of criteria found in the bibliography for what makes a good dungeon map, including making maps that can be categorized in one or more of the basic forms of Figure \ref{fig:basic_dungeons}.

\item \textbf{} Evaluate if the generated maps match the criteria with the application of a survey.
\end{itemize}

\section{Organization of this work}

On Chapter \ref{chapter:related} we will cover works that are related to this one. After that, on Chapter \ref{chapter:proposal} some important information about our proposal is presented. Then, on chapter \ref{chapter:dev} we will provide details on the development and implementation. Chapter \ref{chapter:survey} will cover the creation of the survey and its results. And, lastly on Chapter \ref{chapter:conclusion} we will conclude this work.
