\label{sec:objectives}

Taking motivation from the information presented in the previous sections, this work has been elaborated with the objective of creating a PCG system to design cave-like dungeon maps for 2D top-down games.

More specifically, we will:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{} Utilize a number of algorithms that, combined with user inputs, can generate varied and cave-like dungeon maps.

\item \textbf{} Focus on the PCG category of 'design of level content'. The generated levels can serve as a blueprint for game designers to build upon on the future.

\item \textbf{} Create the maps based on a set of criteria found in the bibliography for what makes a good dungeon map, including making maps that can be categorized in one or more of the basic forms of Figure \ref{fig:basic_dungeons}.

\item \textbf{} Evaluate if the generated maps match the criteria with the application of a survey.
\end{itemize}

The next chapter will cover related works, after that our proposal will be expanded on, then we will provide details on the development and implementation, lastly the survey and it's results will be presented.
