\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First, I would like to thank my advisor Dante Augusto Couto Barone for accepting my work proposal, for guiding me through the many changes we had, for connecting me to the right people, for his incredible availability and for being always helpful. I also would like to thank my co-advisor Leonardo Filipe Batista Silva de Carvalho for the great support and crucial help. 

I'd like to thank Anderson Ferrugem and Raphael Campos for participating in some of our meetings and providing essential information for this work.

Even though I ended up changing the work idea I started with them, I'd like to thank my former advisor Lisandro Zambenedetti Granville and my former coadvisor Lucas Bondan for their understanding.

Finally, I want to thank my parents Nei and Nelci for always being supportive of me, helping and encouraging me to achieve all my goals in life. I'm also thankful for the emotional support and encouragements of all of my friends, and last but not least, my girlfriend DÃ©bora Alexia, who was always there for me during the development of this work.
